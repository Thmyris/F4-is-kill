# F4-is-kill
F4 is literally the most useless key on the keyboard. Make that useless F4 execute one of the most powerful key combos in your computer ever, ALT+F4!

This autohotkey script will change your F4 key's behaviour to mimic an ALT+F4 key press instead. Very useful if you don't have any other use for your F4 key.

Persistent Installation (Windows):
- Just drag and drop the .exe file into the "Startup Folder (allusers).lnk" shortcut. This will effect all user accounts.
- Alternatively, you can go to "C:\Users\YOURUSERIDHERE\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup" and drop the .exe in there. This will only effect your user account.
