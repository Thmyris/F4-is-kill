# F4-is-kill
F4 is literally the most useless key on the keyboard. It's only used for ALT+F4! So make that useless F4 a shortcut for one of the most powerful key combos on your computer ever, ALT+F4, and avoid awkward hand maneuvers while saving precious time!

This autohotkey script will mimic an ALT+F4 key press when you press F4. This is a great ALT+F4 alternative if you don't have any other use for your F4 key.

Persistent Installation (Windows):
- Just drag and drop the .exe file into the "Startup Folder (allusers).lnk" shortcut. This will effect all user accounts.
- Alternatively, you can go to "C:\Users\YOURUSERIDHERE\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup" and drop the .exe in there. This will only effect your user account.

#### Issues
The systray icon is not hidden.
