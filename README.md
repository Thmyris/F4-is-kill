# F4-is-kill
F4 is literally the most useless key on the keyboard. Make that useless F4 execute one of the most powerful key combos in your computer ever, ALT+F4!

This autohotkey script will change your F4 key's behaviour to mimic an ALT+F4 key press instead. Very useful if you don't have another use for your F4 key.

Persistent Installation (Windows):
- Just drag and drop the .exe file into the "Startup Folder (allusers)" shortcut.
